## Chapter 6 â€” Keep Moving Forward

### 6.1 This is a Marathon, Not a Sprint

You spent years digging this hole. Donâ€™t expect to leap out overnight.

Measure progress by months and years.  
Notice deeper changes: less anxiety, richer joy, stronger connections.

### 6.2 Build Brotherhood and Support

Freedom flourishes in community.  
Talk with other men on this journey. Share victories and setbacks.

Youâ€™ll find youâ€™re not aloneâ€”and youâ€™ll draw courage from each other.

### 6.3 Keep Feeding Your Growth

Donâ€™t just remove pornâ€”become a man who outgrows it.

- Read books on masculinity, psychology, spirituality.  
- Watch inspiring talks.  
- Surround yourself with people who live purposefully.

Your mind becomes what you feed it.

### 6.4 Celebrate Who Youâ€™re Becoming

Each day away from porn is a triumph.  
Youâ€™re reclaiming time, focus, and deep joy.

Stand taller. Smile more.  
The man youâ€™re becoming is worth every struggle.
